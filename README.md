## Description
A socket server on top of [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) allowing non-Java applications to obtain predictions/classifications efficiently. This approach (unlike the [command line Weka interface](https://weka.wikispaces.com/Making+predictions)) does not require loading of the model and test data as text files for each prediction. Instead the model is set once and the test data gets submitted over a socket, followed by an immediate reply containing the prediction.

## Run the server using the executable jar

```bash
java -jar .\WekaRemote-3.7.12.jar 9100
```


## Communication format

* First message sent to server must contain the pre-trained .model file path
	A reply from the server will specifies success or failure.

* Requests must be in the following format. Containing all the features in a json array:

```json
{"attributes":[-0.020187378,0.033355713,-0.06762695,-0.008514404,0.0035552979,0.8539276]}
```


* Reply will have the following json format:

```json
{"index":1,"dist":[1.4402003129542426E-10,0.9991183106175616,4.386999171079445E-4,4.4298932131057593E-4],"label":"Idle"}
```
